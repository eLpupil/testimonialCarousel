Tried this challenge to practice html, css and js.
This was my first time creating a carousel component from scratch.

There are issues with the positioning and structure. I'll need to come back to this and redo it from scratch. The child/parent display and position relationships are all screwed up.
The entire structure is bloated and needs to be redesigned.
Need to revisit relationship between child/parent positions/display and inheritance. 


Also the background svg images need to be done a different way. They are following the column structures so I can't change their positions for the mobile view.
